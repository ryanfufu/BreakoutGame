Plan for Breakout Game
Ryan Fu (rwf11)

/*INTERESTING VARIANTS OF THE BREAKOUT GAME*/
Worms:
I thought the Worms variant was an interesting variant because of the variability 
of power-ups to affect the change of pace in the game. As the power-ups fall, the 
player must actively make the decision of whether to prioritize the ball (which keeps the player alive)
or the advantage of enabling a power-up. I would be interested in how to implement these
temporary changes and control the random drop rate after the ball pops each block. 

Pinball Breakout:
I liked the pinball breakout variant because of the presence of the pinball additions. 
I’m curious in how the program reacts to the position of the ball and how the interaction 
between the ball and a pinball object is coded. I think these small additions add a lot of 
variety and uniqueness to the game, and I would like to experiment with how these pinball 
features such as bumpers, holes, and flippers can be implemented. 

I will be choosing to build the WORM breakout version.

A general description of the different levels you intend to build:

/*LEVELS*/
All levels are created through a file input. 

Level 1: All blocks are arranged in the shape of filled square. This was one of my favorite
levels as a kid because the strategy involves shooting the ball at the sides so that the ball 
gets trapped at the top to pop the most blocks. The blocks are compacted and have no space in 
between them

Level 2: Vertically positioned blocks are aligned in a single column. This is applied to the 
adjacent column but instead the blocks are positioned horizontally. There are spaces between 
each block in a column and space between each column. This pattern is repeated several times 
to create the entire level. 

	|   _   |   _   |   _   |   _   |
	|   _   |   _   |   _   |   _   |
	|   _   |   _   |   _   |   _   |
	|   _   |   _   |   _   |   _   |
	|   _   |   _   |   _   |   _   |


Level 3: In this level, there are horizontal and vertical blocks forming three concentric 
squares with space between each layer. There are no spaces between adjacent blocks.

/*BLOCKS*/
Normal Block: 
	Block gets destroyed if hit by ball once. 
	
Metal Block: 
	Block cannot be destroyed. The player does not have to destroy a metal block to win the game. 
	Intended to add more barriers to make it difficult for the ball to hit certain blocks.
	
TNT Block: 
	Block gets destroyed if hit by ball once. If destroyed, all adjacent blocks are destroyed. 
	
Brick Block: 
	Blocks gets destroyed if hit by ball 3 times. 

There is a 0.25 chance of a destroyed block to drop a random power-up. 
Each level will have a random placement of varying block-types that will be created based on a random algorithm. 

/*POWER UPS*/
Freeze: 
	Ball moves at a slower speed
	
Lightning: 
	Ball moves at a faster speed

Extra Life:
	If acquired, the player receives an extra life	
	
Explosion: 
	Ball explodes into 5 balls 
	
Invincible: 
	Ball will destroy any block it hits for 5 seconds. The ball will not reflect off any blocks, only walls.
	This can even destroy metal blocks.

/*PADDLE FUNCTIONS*/
These paddle functions can also be acquired through random falling power-ups from destroyed bricks. 
Large: 
	Paddle length increases by a short amount
	
Mini: 
	Paddle length decreases by a short amount
	
Warp:
	Paddle can warp from one side of the screen to the other when it reaches the edge. If acquired, this
	power-up lasts for the entire level.
	
Oil:
	Paddle moves at a faster speed. 


/*CHEAT KEYS*/
1. “r”
	If the key “r” is pressed, the game will reset back to level 1 and the game will be restarted

2. “+” 
	If the “+” key is pressed, the size of the ball increases (up to a maximum size)
	
3. “-“ 
	If the “-“ key is pressed, the size of the ball decreases (down to a minimum size)

4. “spacebar” 
	If the “spacebar” key is pressed, the game is paused, but the paddle can be moved.

/*STATUS DISPLAY*/
1. Current Score
	Current score of the game is displayed at the top right of the screen.
2. Current Level
	Current level of the game is displayed at the top middle of the screen.
3. Current Lives
	Number of lives left is displayed at the top left of the screen.

/*SPLASH SCREEN*/
Home page that explains how to play the game and documented cheat keys. It will stay visible until the player 
presses the "enter" key.

/*SOMETHING EXTRA*/
I want to add the ability for the player to unlock different colored balls. These balls can only be 
permanently unlocked if certain requirements are met. In addition, I want to add a key “t” that will 
allow the player to toggle the appearance of the balls based on these unlocks. This adds a level of 
achievement to the game while giving the player to customize the look of the game to their own liking. 

In addition, I want to add music and sound effects to the action of a block being destroyed by the ball. 
I believe that this addition will make the experience more interactive and more unique for the player, 
thus enhancing the overall experience.
